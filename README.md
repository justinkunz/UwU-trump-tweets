# Trump UwU Auto Tweeter

This app creates a Twitter stream of @realdonaldtrump's tweets, converts it to a cringey UwU format, then reposts the owo version. Heavily influenced by the [trump_owo twitter](https://twitter.com/trump_owo?lang=en).

### Example

###### Input

```
So pathetic to watch the Fake News Lamestream Media playing down the gravity and depravity of the Radical Left, looters and thugs, ripping up our Liberal Democrat run (only) cities. It is almost like they are all working together?
```

###### Output

```
*nuzzles* So pathetic to watch the Fake News Wamestweam Media pwaying down the gwavity and depwavity of the Wadicaw Weft, wootews and thugs, wipping up ouw Wibewaw Democwat wun (onwy) cities >.< It is awmost wike they awe aww wowking togethew?
```
